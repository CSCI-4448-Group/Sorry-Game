Game Application&#10;&#10;# Setup&#10;* Choose four pawns of the same color. Put all four on that color START space.&#10;* Shuffle the deck. Place face down on &quot;Place Pack Here&quot; to form Draw pile.&#10;* Pick a player to go first. Movement is clockwise around the board and play passes to the left.&#10;&#10;# Game Play&#10;**Note**: If it's your first turn and you do not draw a card that lets you start a pawn out, you forfeit (skip) your turn.&#10;On all turns, take the top card on the Draw pile and move accordingly. Drawn card will be removed from the deck.&#10;&#10;# To Start A Pawn&#10;To move a pawn from your START out onto the track, you must draw either a 1 or a 2. If it is a 2, do as it says, then draw again and move if possible. You may not start a pawn out with any other cards!&#10;&#10;# Jumping and Bumping&#10;You may jump over your own or another player's pawn that's in your way, counting it as one space. But...if you land on a space that's already occupied by an opponent's pawn, BUMP that pawn back to its own color START space.&#10;&#10;# Moving Backwards&#10;4 and 10 cards move you backwards. If you have successfully moved a pawn backwards at least two spaces beyond your own START space, you may, on a subsequent turn, move into your own SAFETY ZONE without moving all the way around the board.&#10;&#10;# Notes:&#10;* Two pawns of the same color may never occupy the same space. If your only possible move would make you land on a space already occupied by another of your own pawns, you forfeit your turn.&#10;* If at any time you cannot move, you forfeit your turn.&#10;* But if at nay time you can move, you must move, even if it is to your disadvantage.&#10;* If you run out of cards, in the Draw pile, the application will regenerate a new deck.&#10;&#10;# Winning&#10;If you get all four of your pawns HOME first, you win! If you play again, the winner goes first.&#10;&#10;# The Board&#10;**Home**: You must bring all four of your pawns into HOME by exact count! Once HOME, do not move that pawn again for the rest of the game. &#10;**Slide**: Regardless which card sent you there, any time you land by exact count on the triangle at the beginning of a slide that is not your own color, slide ahead to the end and BUMP any pawns in your way--including your own!--back to their own START spaces. If you land on a SLIDE of your own color, don't slide. Just stay put on the triangle. &#10;**Safety Zone**: Only you may enter your own color SAFETY ZONE. All other rules apply. No pawn may enter its SAFETY ZONE by a backward move. However, a pawn may move backward out of its SAFETY ZONE and on subsequent turns move back into the ZONE as cards permit. &#10;**Start a Pawn Here**: If you've drawn a 1 card, take a pawn from START and put it into this circle: your turn ends. If you draw a 2, move a pawn out AND draw again! You may not have two pawns on an entry circle at the same time. If another player's pawn is on your entry circle, BUMP it back to its own START. &#10;&#10;# The Cards&#10;**1** Move a pawn onto the outer starting circle, or move a pawn one space forward. &#10;**2** Move a pawn onto the outer starting circle, or move a pawn two spaces forward. Draw again, even if you could not move a pawn.  &#10;**3** Move a pawn forward three spaces.&#10;**4** Move a pawn backward four spaces. &#10;**5** Move a pawn forward five spaces.&#10;**7** Move a pawn forward seven spaces, or split the movement between two pawns.&#10;**8** Move a pawn forward eight spaces. &#10;**10** Move a pawn forward 10 spaces, or move a pawn backward one space. &#10;**11** Move a pawn forward 11 spaces, or switch the position of any one of your pawns with any one of your opponents pawns. &#10;**SORRY!** Take one pawn from your “START” position and move it to any legal space occupied by an opponent (no “HOME”, “START”, or “SAFETY ZONE” spaces), and bump the opponent back to their “START” space. If you have no pawns in the “START” space, or there are no legal pawns to bump, end your turn." />
